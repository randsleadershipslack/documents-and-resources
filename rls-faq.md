# RLS: How It Works / FAQ

## How did this place come about? Who is responsible for it? How is it paid for?

This Slack was gifted to Rands prior to his stint as the VP of Engineering at the company because of a talk he did for the engineering team. After that talk, Rands became the VP of Engineering, and one of the benefits was a complimentary Pro (the version that, among other features, keeps a complete history of conversations) instance.

Rands is the single "workspace owner" of this Slack instance. While Rands no longer works at Slack, we have confirmed with Slack executives multiple times that this instance has been grandfathered in as a forever complimentary instance.

There is no payment for this Slack; it is complimentary, thanks to Salesforce/Slack.

## How big is RLS? How many monthly active users do we have? How much does it grow?

At the time of this writing, RLS has just under 38,000 members. These are not all active members. Active member varies quite a bit, but currently hovers around 7,000 per month. New membership varies, as well, but RLS steadily grows around 1% per month, adding 300 to 400 new members a month.

## How are new members added to this community? What process do they need to go through? Who does this work? How do I invite someone?

We have a deliberately laborious process by which new members are added. This is to both make sure about a new member's commitment while also keeping out the robots. This process has increased in friction over time. This is how it works:

1. A member sends an email to our invite address (invites@randsinrepose.com) with a set of required information.
2. If they fail to supply all the information, we request the same information again.
3. If they succeed in supplying the information, we send them an invite with onboarding guidance.

This is a manual process done entirely by Rands. There is no automation, save for templates (Welcome, Need More Info) that Rands sends along with guidance. Slack's terms of service do not allow for automated invites, although there are communities that do this. While we've allowed members to /invite in the past, we disabled this process because it skips over onboarding, which we consider essential.

## Who are the admins? How are they selected? How long do they serve?

*[This section appears to be a placeholder/header only in the original document]*

## What is the purpose of the Code of Conduct? How is it used? How is it updated?

The Code of Conduct is a living document that describes the goals and values of the community. It also describes expectations within the community that reflect these goals and values. Finally, it describes rules that both the community and the admins enforce within the community. A companion document, the Incident Process, clarifies the process the admins use to investigate and resolve incidents within the community.

The Code of Conduct was originally forked from [this](https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct). It has been significantly updated over the years to better reflect the values of the RLS community. Other than grammar and spelling pull requests, it is updated by Rands with help from the current set of admins. If you have a question about the Code of Conduct, you can ask in #this-channel.

## How are channels and content moderated in a community of this size?

By design, there is no centralized moderation authority at the Rands Leadership Slack. As a large leadership community, our expectation is that members are the first line of defense against content that does not belong within the community. The goals with this strategy are that it scales (there are more members than admins), and the purpose of leadership is to lead. Our expectation is that part of the reason members are here is to lead, and asking a member to remove or change a post is leading. Important to note: you not liking the content of a post does not mean it's a candidate for removal or change.

In the event the offending post is not handled, we have an escalation process that pulls in the admins as documented in both our Code of Conduct and Incident Process.

## How do we prevent other nefarious things from happening within the community?

Up front: if a human or robot has a valid account on this Slack, they can easily pull public data down from this community. Do not assume that what you say in public is confidential because it's not. It is against our Code of Conduct (and Slack's terms of service), but, again, it is trivial to pull public data down from this Slack with a valid user account.

## Given the size of this community, what work do we do to prevent data exfiltration or other nefarious things? (Explain apps, plugins, etc. strategy)

## Was Slack designed for a community use case? Why do we use Slack?

## What if Rands is hit by a bus?

Sad, but given the size of the community, succession planning is a good idea. In the case that Rands were to vanish, one of the admins would request Slack to transfer workspace ownership to them, which would allow that admin access to the small set of workspace owner-specific features. Whether this transfer would trigger any change to the complimentary plan we benefit from is speculation.

Operational tasks (such as invites, etc.) would fall on the current admins to refactor in the absence of Rands.

## What unique responsibilities does Rands have relative to admin?

Workspace owner is the primary contact for Slack. Workspace owner can:

- Transfer ownership
- Delete the workspace
- Manage admins
- Approve/deny data export requests
