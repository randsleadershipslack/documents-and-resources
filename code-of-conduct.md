All participants in the Rands Leadership Slack are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. Administrators (see below for definition of administrators) will enforce this code throughout the service ("Team"). 

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people; respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; respect privacy; understand we're mostly not-for-profit; and if you can’t resolve an issue contact the administrators. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you may be asked to leave the Team.

# The Long Version

## Respect

The Rands Leadership Slack is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our community.

The Rands Leadership Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:

* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the administrators. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
* Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it. 

## Privacy

This community is not a public space, but no has signed an NDA to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

If you want to use ideas found on this Slack, we ask that you ask the originator of the idea for permission. If said person is no longer available, we ask that you credit the “Rands Leadership Slack.”

If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use Chatham House Rule as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).

## Not for Profit

This community is mostly not a place for commercial activity such as recruiting or marketing except in channels dedicated to that purpose which are:

* #jobs
* #consulting-gigs
* #conferences
* #services 

If join this community to just sell things and not contribute and learn, the community will quickly notice. 

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an administrator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.

## Consequences

If the administrators determine that a human is behaving violating any part of this Code of Conduct, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate within this Slack team, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the Team.

As administrators, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can’t foresee every situation, and thus if in the administrator's judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so.
