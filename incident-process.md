# Things Sometimes Go Sideways

In any group of humans, things will sometimes go sideways. Whether it's simple unintentional miscommunication or more extreme unacceptable behavior, we need to have an agreed upon protocol to resolve these situations ourselves or to escalate in the case one-to-one resolutons in unachievable. 

This is the process for incident resolution at Rands Leadership Slack. 

# The Process

## Resolve Peacefully 

When an incident occurs, we ask that per the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) for those involved to resolve peacefully:

“If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.”

This is easier said than done, but this is Leadership Slack. Our expectations are that everyone here is hoping to learn about the craft of leadership; peaceful resolution of complex human situation is leadership 101.

## Escalation

Resolution amongst the individuals will not always be achievable. In this case, the reporter of the incident has a choice. They can immediately raise the incident to the administrator (see below for specifics) or they can share the incident with #rands-slack-rules and seek feedback and perhaps resolution on the incident. We understand the need for the former workflow, but we highly encourage the latter because, again, this is a leadership Slack. Our hope is that the debate will help educate this sub-community of humans interested in the rules and culture that govern this small corner of the Internet. 

When ready and if appropriate, the reporter needs to send the adminstrator a direct message with the following information. 

1. What’s the nature of the incident and/or CoC violation? 
2. Who is involved in this incident?
3. What material supports this situation?
4. Any privacy concerns? (The reporter may choose to keep the incident private.)

With this information in hand, the administrator will strive to respond to the reporter as quickly as possible with an estimate of when they think they’ll be able to triage and resolve this incident. In extreme cases, the administrator may suspend one or more accounts until they are able to triage and resolve an incident. 

Incident resolution can vary from hours to days depending on the availability of those involved. Once the incident is resolved, the administrator will communicate the resolution to the reporter and other other parties relevant to the incident. In extreme cases, the administrator will communicate the resolution with #rands-slack-rules with reporter permission.

## Appeal of Account Suspension

In cases the result in account suspension, the individual suspended may appeal the decision starting one week after the suspension by sending a mail to the administrator with justification for overturning the appeal. If an suspension is overturned, the context will be shared with #rands-slack-rules

# FAQ:

- “Is situation XYZ an incident?” Unsure if there’s a CoC violation? Ask #rands-slack-rules and/or DM me. We'll help. 
- “How many incidents have you handled since this place started?” Six as of Fall 2017.
